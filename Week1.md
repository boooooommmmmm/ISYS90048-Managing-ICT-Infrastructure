* Client-server computing – Locally stored documents, software
* High capacity networks allow software, servers, storage to be distant from users
* Not every company needs every specialisation of IT capability
* Develop new capabilities quickly, reducing time to market
* Shift to 24-7 operations <br /> 

* Better cash-flow
