## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing occurs when a combination of ICT-based services are delivered over a network using a configuration of virtualised resources

<br />

### Three component architecture:

* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
* Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

<br />

# Essential Cloud Characteristics

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access: using multiple devices to access it.
* Resource pooling: Location independence; multiple clients; => don't care where it come from
* Rapid elasticity and flexibility
* Measured service

<br />

### Advatages / disadvateges

* Performance
* cost
* Instant software update
* storage capacity
* Device independence
* Elasticity / flexibility
* ============
* constant internet connection
* compatibility with cloud's data bases / data centre
* Standards
* Robust network access

<br />

### Cloud security

* Redundancy / Disaster Recovery
* homogeneity makes security auditing/testing simpler
* enable automated security management
* =================
* Trusting vendor’s security model
* Loss of physical control
* Indirect administrator accountability
  <br />
  <br />

### SaaS

* SaaS offers applications as services, running on the provider’s infrastructure and serving multiple client organisations.
* Google Docs, MS Office 365...
* No upfront investment
* No actual licence
* Software support, including hosting, capacity management, deployment, authorisation of use and upgrade is managed by the ISP and is online
* The software is typically highly re-entrant – many clients can be using the same software at the same time
* Strong focus on interoperability and modular reuse
* Low-cost addition of new features
* Level of SaaS: Ad-hoc -> Configurable -> Configurable, Re-entrant -> Configurable, Re-entrant & Scalable

### SaaS advantages / dis

* Higher resource utilisation rates
* integration and shared resource usage
* lower power
* Disaster recovery
* Increased focus on service delivery, rather than technology
* Greater agility in service
* =======================
* Increased reliance on SaaS
* Reduced freedom in migration to new systems
* Server fees


<br />
<br />

### PaaS

* Virtual systems 

<br />
<br />

### IaaS

* At the lowest layer IaaS provides the basic networking, storage, processing, including backup and recovery, typically through virtualisation technology
* For web hosting company

## Service management

Service Management is a key component of IT Infrastructure management
