### Organisation and ICT Alignment



**No organisation will ever reach the goal of business and ICT alignment**

- Difficult
- Marketplace changes
- No organisation is perfect in alignment but they must attempt to go though it.



* **Aim**->Efficiency(security and reliability)


* Assumes information about what the company plans to do
* Assumes best practices

​		 everything works

* Governance framework for it

* Easier for organisations to communicate, share information, streamline business processes and **respond to change**

  ​	Example: CEO -> senior managers -> middle managers -> department supervisors -> works

  ​			CEO -> works

* Enables planners to process, store, secure and manage information -> also for decision makers

* Provide future effectiveness -> improvement in the organisation’s performance
