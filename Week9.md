## Data Centre



Data centre is complex and expensive

Data Centre Infrastructure Management (DCIM)



Today 

Servers connected to each other

Data-intensive

Data centres -> massive computing



#### Definition

A data centre is a facility composed of **networked computers** and **storage** (servers, power supply, backup, cooling system) that businesses or other organisations use to organise, process, store and disseminate large amounts of data



Acting as an enabling technology to help both public and private services in ICT infrastructure.



### Complex set of priorities

1. lower the cost -> outsourcing
2. Making sure the business have easy access to the ICT resources that allow them to transform services



The best, fastest, most risk-averse approach for this is to leverage converged infrastructure platforms -> simple, easy-to-deploy infrastructure platform which can quick build and run core business applications.



Converged infrastructure needs: reduce time and cost of procuring, deploying, configuring, and managing hardware and software components separately.

Then  automate the delivery of ICT services â€“> Built well-designed API-driven (middleware) services

=> Data centre





### Solution



* **Converged infrastructure platforms** are the most **efficient** and effective way for modern data centres operations
* **All-in-one** storage, compute, and network platforms simplify, speed up, and radically transform the traditional IT process of building things component by component
* Everything is **automated**
* Extreme **modularity**
* Servers connected to each other, data-intensive, massive scale
* Data centres become the computing backbone
* Offers economy-of-scale and better Efficiency





#### Data centre & cloud

Data Centres are also moving to the Cloud

* To ease data centre management
* More computing power is being sold by cloud providers (IaaS)
* Cloud services costs are decreasing while data centre costs are increasing



Data centre location is also an issue

Data Centre as a Service (DCaaS)



### Challenge

* load balancing
* Bandwidth
* power
* cooling
* back up
* network management
* security
* Infrastructure management
* Cost
* Reliability
* Scalability



### Data Centre Infrastructure Management



Provide an effective bridge to support the operational responsibilities and dependencies between facilities and IT personnel to eliminate the potential silos



Includes:

* Asset Management
* Network connectivity Management
* Environment Management
* Energy Management
* Change Management
* Capacity Management



**Risk**

System and Technology complexity

Virtualisation

Disaster recovery and business continuity

Remote access
