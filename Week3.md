## Standards

<br />

* An industry standard refers to a set of specifications to which all elements of products, processes and designs under its realm must conform
* Enables effective coordination => 
* Enable agreement to reach the solutions
  <br />

###What are standards?

* Measure of quality
* Address the needs for interconnection and interoperability.
* Ensure the safety and reliability
* For protecting user and business interests and in support of government policies.
* ================
* **Safely, efficiently, reliably.**


### Standardisation process

1. Market driven choice => developers propose => market player choose => enhance or modify
2. Formal standards => The specifications of the standard are derived by a recognised standards body => ISO
3. Regulatory standards => These standards are developed and ratified by government agencies and an enforced through regulations. => public safety or large economies => national economic strategy

<br />
<br />

### Positive Effects

<br />
* Greater market efficiency and hence market expansion
* Hence trade
* Reduce barriers to new developers/new market entrants
* diffusion of new technologies and foster **innovation** 
* Reduce market risk and generate better returns
* Enhance **interoperability **between products and processes
* Customer confidence


<br />
<br />

### Negative Effects

* Fovour the first entrants' design...
* not ensure that the best, most efficient or effective design wins
* 
  <br />
  <br />

### Development of a Standard

<br />

### ICT Standards in Organisations

* Technological aspects => Atchitecture design, development, System/requirement engineering..
* Regulation and legislation relating to ICT => Auditing, software licenses, outsourcing...
* Environmental impact

## Interoperability

**Definition**: **Interoperability **is the ability of information and communication technology (ICT) systems and of the business processes they support to **exchange data** and to enable the sharing of information and knowledge

**Definition**: An **Interoperability Framework ** is a set of standards and guidelines that describe the way in which systems and organisations have agreed, or should agree, to interact with each other




### Principles

* Accessibility
* MultiLingualis => multi languages
* Security
* Privacy
* Open satandards
* Open source
* Interfaces: Multilateral: Many to many; Bilateral: One to one
* Multilateral solution

<br />

### kinds of interoperability

1. Organisation interoperability => supply chain partners => improving services to the user community, and reducing costs these users and consumers.
2. Semantic interoperability => computer system to exchange data
3. Technical interoperability => Deals with communication protocols, data exchange and message passing among application systems

# ICT governance frameworks
<br />
<br />

## Definiation

* Corporate governance is the rules, practices and processes by which an organisation is managed, directed and controlled.
* ICT Governance is a subset of Corporate Governance, focused on ICT system.

### Why using governance

* Increase management awareness of ICT related risks
* Focus on ICT cost
* Improve the management and control of ICT activities
* ICT governance -> who makes decisions; management -> making and implementing the decisions.

### An effective ICT governance need make sure following questions:

* What decisions much be made
* Who should make these decisions
* How are they made and monitored

<br />
<br />
<br />
**ITIL: IT focussed controls; COBIT: Business-IT alignment focused controls**
<br />

<br />
### Structure of ICT Frameworks

* Framework: a particular set of beliefs, ideas, or rules referred to in order to solve problems within a specific realm.
* Scope
* Ontology: 形而上学 -> definition of the key concepts in the scope, and the relationships between those concepts.
* Body of Knowledge
* Methodology
* Standards
* Measure
* Continuous Improvement

<br />
<br /> 

### Good and bad using ICT governance

* Executive buy-in is essential
* Develop structures first
* Develop processes next
* Don’t start from scratch 草稿
* Alignment of business and ICT
* Communicate, communicate, communicate
* Governance is separated from management
* =================
* Poor ICT governance can put the oranisation's bussiness value at risk
* Not in place
* Unplaned systems, complex systems
* impact in customer expericence

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## COBIT 5

COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

COBIT is a framework and supporting tool set that allows managers to bridge the gap with respect to control requirements, technical issues and business risks, and communicate that level of control to shareholders

clear policies and good practice for IT control through enterprises

Extended serve: providing maturity models, critical success factors, key goal indicators, and key performance indicators

### Key principles

1. Meet stakeholders’ needs
2. Cover the enterprise from end-to-end
3. Apply a single integrated framework across the whole enterprise
4. Enable a holistic approach to ICT governance
5. Separate ICT Governance from Management
  <br /><br />
  <br /><br />

## ITIL

ITIL is focused on Service Delivery and Service Level Management.

Five stages loop: Service Strtegy -> Service Design -> Service Transition -> Service Operation -> Continual Service Improvement -> Service Strtegy 

Total 26 processes

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

## Limiations of ICT frameworks

* Largely based on industry input, not academic theory or critically assessed practice
* Limited ontologies
* Typically contain only references to components of the body of knowledge and relevant methodologies.
* Full content publications are only available commercially.
* Courses are not free.
* Many ICT frameworks with varying levels of overlap
* Aligned with ICT professional bodies or government agencies.
