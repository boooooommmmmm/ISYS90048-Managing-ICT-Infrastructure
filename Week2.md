* Blockchain
* conversation system - Siri
* Mesh app and service architecture
  ....

### challenge
* Increasing geographic distribution of organisations - distribution of outsourcing and physical location
* Increasing availability of enabling technologies and social networking tools - cost/asynchronous communication
* Impending shortage of knowledge workers
* Demands for more flexibility in work practice
* Pressure for more sustainable enterprises and work styles - Sustainability: environmental, social/cultural & financial - more requirement
